                   I had the privilege of working with Peter at Westfield. I recruited Peter initially for a vulnerability management project reviewing c. 40,000 IP assets of various kinds. His next project was a 4000 user Crowdstrike global deployment from product selection to project completion and handover to the service desk. He did everything that was asked of him, and he did not disappoint.

Peter not only knows his subject area inside out. He can turn a complex problem into something manageable and straightforward, which is very rare. Peter is calm under pressure, and nothing is too much trouble. As a contractor, he always went above and beyond and often stayed to 9/10pm working on project deliverables that were required. 

Peter was one of the few that can be described as reliable, capable, proactive, and approachable. I would ask for assistance and guarantee that he would deliver. Whether it’s about technologies where he's the SME of a particular area or guidance on malware analysis or threat hunting, he was my go-to. Peter would not hesitate to offer his mentorship or resources whenever you needed it. 

If given the opportunity, I would love to work with Peter again in the future, and if (or when) I build another team, Peter's name will be number one on the list.

                    Working with Peter is an absolute pleasure. He is punctual, knowledgeable and a hard working Security professional with a wealth of experience. He takes an analytical approach and ensures all tasks he is given is delivered to an exceptionally high standard and regularly goes above and beyond! (So much so on multiple occasions he has stayed well later than 8PM to ensure tasks were delivered!

I would not hesitate to recommend Peter for any future roles in the slightest.
